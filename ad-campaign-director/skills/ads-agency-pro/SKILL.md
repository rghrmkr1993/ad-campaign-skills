# Ads Agency Pro — 2026 Client Campaign Playbook

Agency operating system for running paid media for clients — **any region, any industry**.
This skill is the **strategy + regional + vertical layer**. It pairs well with:

- **`ads` skill ([claude-ads plugin](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-ads))** — optional
  but recommended: structured audits, deterministic scoring, JSON reports, capability-gated
  account changes. Use it for the mechanics; use THIS skill for what to do in your markets
  and verticals.
- **Meta Ads MCP tools** (`ads_*`) if connected — direct API access to campaigns, ad sets,
  creatives, audiences, insights, A/B and lift tests.
- **Browser automation** — Google Ads, YouTube Studio, GA4, TikTok Ads Manager.
- **Your creative stack** — AI video/UGC generation, Canva or equivalent, copywriting
  skills, landing-page skills.

## Account registry (maintain your own — TEMPLATE)

Keep this table updated with YOUR accounts. Verify the right account before every action.

| Platform | Account | Login | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Ads | `XXX-XXX-XXXX` | `your-ads-login@example.com` | Billing model, tax status |
| Meta | Business Manager + ad account per client | — | Never run client work on a personal ad account. Pixel + CAPI per client. |
| TikTok | Per-client | — | Check availability per geo (e.g., **banned in India**). |

## 2026 core doctrine (applies to every campaign, everywhere)

1. **Creative is the targeting.** Meta Andromeda and TikTok Smart+ retrieve ads by creative
   signal, not audience settings. Budget creative volume before budgeting media: 10-15
   conceptually distinct concepts per campaign, 20+ new ads/month for active accounts.
2. **Concepts, not variations.** Similar ads collapse into one Entity ID on Meta — 30 lookalike
   ads = 1 ad to the algorithm. Diversify angle, emotion, format, and creator, not just colors.
3. **Consolidate structure.** 1-3 ad sets per campaign max. Advantage+ Shopping / PMax as
   workhorses. Fragmented structures starve the learning phase.
4. **Broad beats narrow.** Lookalikes and interest stacks are legacy. Go broad + let creative
   segment. Exceptions: genuine niche B2B and fan-base entertainment marketing.
5. **Signal quality is the moat.** Pixel + CAPI together, Event Match Quality ≥ 7, GA4 +
   enhanced conversions on Google, offline conversion import for lead-gen. No launch without
   conversion tracking verified end-to-end.
6. **Video-first everywhere.** 9:16 native vertical for Reels/Shorts/TikTok. Hook < 2s,
   brand < 3s, text overlays for sound-off. UGC-style outperforms studio polish (24% higher
   ROAS, ~47% lower CPM on Meta).
7. **Patience windows.** Let algorithms learn 7-10 days before judging. Expect ad fatigue at
   2-3 weeks — plan refresh cadence (25-30% of assets every 2 weeks at scale).

## Platform quick sheet

| Platform | 2026 play | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Meta | Andromeda era: A+SC primary, creative volume, EMQ ≥ 7 | [references/platforms-2026.md](references/platforms-2026.md) |
| Google | Power Pack: PMax (50-60% ecom budget) + AI Max Search (30-40%) + Demand Gen (10-20%) | same |
| YouTube | Shorts ≥ 20-30% of YT spend for <35 audiences; CTV for premium brand | same |
| TikTok | Smart+ for web, GMV Max default for TikTok Shop; check per-geo availability | same |

## Geo coverage — any market

  & bans, language map, payment/commerce mechanics, seasonal calendar, privacy/compliance,
  CPM tier, creator ecosystem.

  Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Oceania.

  economics, creative codes, benchmark bands, measurement model, seasonality.

  travel, automotive, gaming/apps, B2B/SaaS, local services, luxury/jewelry, electronics.

| Layer | Contents | File |
|---|---|---|
| Foundations | 28 marketing disciplines map, journey models (AIDA/TOFU/Flywheel/AARRR/RACE/See-Think-Do-Care), objective-selection matrix | [references/marketing-foundations.md](references/marketing-foundations.md) |

## Standard engagement workflow (new client)

1. **Intake** — business goal, AOV/LTV, margins, target ROAS/CPA ceiling, geo list, languages,
   existing assets/accounts. Get Business Manager / Google Ads access via proper partner
   delegation (never passwords).
2. **Audit** — invoke the `ads` skill for a source-grounded audit if account has history;
   otherwise baseline: tracking, feeds, past creative, competitor scan (Meta Ads Library;
   Google Ads Transparency Center).
3. **Measurement first** — pixel + CAPI (Meta), Google tag + enhanced conversions, GA4,
   catalog/feed health. Verify test events BEFORE any spend.
4. **Structure** — per doctrine above. One prospecting (broad) + one retargeting + optional
   test campaign per platform. Name convention: `{CLIENT}-{GEO}-{OBJ}-{YYYYMM}`.
5. **Creative sprint** — 10-15 concepts across angles (problem, desire, social proof, founder,
   demo, UGC, meme where fit). Localize per language market — separate ad sets per language,
   never mixed.
6. **Launch small, scale on signal** — 7-10 day learning window, then scale winners 20-30%
   per step; kill losers at concept level, not variation level.
7. **Report** — weekly: spend, ROAS/CPA vs target, creative leaderboard, next tests.
8. **Client dashboard** — daily results dashboard per
   [references/client-dashboard-spec.md](references/client-dashboard-spec.md).

## Guardrails

- Never launch, edit budgets, or change live campaigns without explicit owner approval.
- Verify platform availability per geo before planning (bans/restrictions move).
- Seasonal peaks inflate CPMs (up to 2-3x at the biggest events) — book creative and lock
  budgets 4-6 weeks ahead; never start a learning phase inside a peak.
- Every regulated-vertical ad (health claims, finance, housing, etc.) passes the compliance
  checks in [references/vertical-playbooks.md](references/vertical-playbooks.md) before
  submission.
- Check the billing model (prepaid vs postpaid, tax registration) per account/market before
  launch week.
